Absolutely. Here’s the checklist I’ll follow whenever adding content to new lessons:
Code snippets
Use the shared CodeSnippet component for all examples/errors.
Ensure there’s spacing between the snippet and buttons (handled by CodeSnippet’s built-in margin).
Add onRun={handleTryNow} so the Run button opens the in-page playground (same-tab).
The snippet header includes:
Open-in-new-tab icon (left)
Run
Copy code
Try Now behavior
Keep existing TRY NOW buttons; they must open the same in-page playground dialog using handleTryNow(code).
In Try Now dialogs, include “Open in new tab” linking to /runner?lang=<lang>&code=<base64-utf8>.
Runners
Inline runners are side-by-side: editor (left) + output (right).
Footer buttons order: Open in new tab, Reset, Run.
Use UTF-8 safe base64 for passing code between pages.
Consistency
Apply the same snippet UI and behaviors across all lessons and languages.
Ensure snippets never touch adjacent buttons/text (spacing preserved).
Prefer CodeSnippet over raw <pre><code>/<code>.
If you want, I can codify this into a short contribution guide file (e.g., CONTRIBUTING-LESSONS.md) for future editors.
